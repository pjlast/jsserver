# jsserver

`jsserver` is my attempt at learning something about type inference and in the process
trying to answer the question: "How far can we get without type annotations in JavaScript?".

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.21. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
